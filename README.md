# ToDoList-Project

Welcome !

First of all, you need dependencies !

Go to backend and frontend, and in both of them, use the following command :
``` npm install ``` or ``` yarn install ```

Then, in the backend, use the following command :
``` npm build ``` or ``` yarn build ```

To start the server, go to backend, then use the following command :
``` npm start ``` or ``` yarn start ```

To see our beautilful webapp, go to frontend, then use the following command :
``` npm start ``` or ``` yarn start ```

The backend will be available at ```localhost:3000``` and frontend at ```localhost:8080```

Enjoy !
